# Environmental Analysis

## Introduction  

**Chloe Lang**
*Geography and Information Systems and Technology (GIST)*

I am originally from SE Massachusetts but have been living in RI for the past 5 years for my undergrad. I became interested in GIS after doing an internship tracking coyote movement in RI. I hope to move to the west coast to work with either wildfire relief/recovery or work in the National Park System. 

### Concept List
1. I am interested in learning different statistical analyses that are used in different types of environmental data analysis.
2. am also interested to learn more about R coding and become familiar with using it. 
3. I am interested in learning all of these new concepts and being able to apply it to real world scenarios. 

### Course List 
*Wetland Wildlife Management

*Mammology

*Field Botany and Taxonomy
